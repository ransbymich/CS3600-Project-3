2020 - Intro to AI Project 3, assignment details linked [here](https://bhrolenok.github.io/teaching/cs-3600-spr2020/project3/index.html)

This project taught me about particle filtering, exact and approximate filtering. This allowed Mr. Pacman to "hear" the ghosts within the environment to hunt them down.

Commited late to avoid 3 day late period shenaniga
